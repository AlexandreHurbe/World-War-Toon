Stuff implemented already:
1. Camera controls (zoom, pan, rotate)
2. Basic movement (Standing movements, Crouch movements, movements consist of strafing while aiming as well)
3. Basic base class for weapon behaviour
4. Animations related to movement and aiming have been added
5.

Bugs:
1. Some data is not being passed on from M1GarandBehaviour to WeaponBehaviour even though WeaponBehaviour is the WeaponClass
2. The aimline from gun end to mouse position is not working
3. The rotation of players head towards mouse position whilst not aiming does not work as well
4. Animations need to be refined
5. The player's gun is not always completely aligned with the mouse position when aiming.

Stuff that needs to be implemented:
1. Camera culling
